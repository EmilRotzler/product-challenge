# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# Project structure

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the project's structure and architecture before adding or moving files.

# Responsive design

All UI must work responsively across both desktop and mobile viewports, since users access this app from PCs and phones. Test layouts at common breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop) before considering UI work complete.
